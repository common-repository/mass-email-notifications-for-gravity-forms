Mass Email Notifications for Gravity Forms allows you to send your notifications to anyone who filled out one of your forms!

== Description ==

**Mass Email Notifications for Gravity Forms** is a powerful plugin designed to extend the capabilities of your Gravity Forms by allowing you to send mass email notifications to users who have previously filled out any form on your site.

Whether you’re running a campaign, sending updates, or simply notifying a specific group of respondents, this plugin makes it easy to reach your audience with just one form submission.

By leveraging Gravity Forms’ built-in email fields and intuitive interface, you can send personalized notifications to multiple recipients with ease.

For advanced users, the premium version offers robust filtering options, allowing you to target specific entries based on conditional logic.

### Key Features:

- **Bulk Send Notifications:** This feature allows you to send mass email notifications to all entries from a selected Gravity Form. Whether you’re targeting a large group or just a few recipients, you can do it all with a single form submission. This is perfect for sending newsletters, updates, or reminders without the need to manually enter each email address.
- **Conditional Logic Filtering:** With the premium version, you can refine your email targets using conditional logic. This means you can filter entries based on any field within the target form, such as specific responses, dates, or custom criteria. This feature ensures that your emails are sent only to the most relevant recipients, enhancing the effectiveness of your communication.
- **Utilize Built-In Email Fields:** The plugin fully integrates with Gravity Forms’ native email fields, ensuring seamless functionality. You don’t need to worry about compatibility issues or complex configurations—just select the email field from your form and start sending notifications immediately.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The plugin integrates directly within the Gravity Forms notification configuration area, providing a seamless experience. The intuitive interface makes it easy for users of all technical levels to set up and manage their mass email notifications. You can configure everything in just a few clicks, without needing to leave the familiar Gravity Forms environment.

### Benefits:
- **Efficient Communication:** With the ability to send mass emails from a single form submission, you save time and effort. Instead of manually sending emails to each respondent, you can automate the process and ensure that everyone who needs to receive the message gets it immediately. This efficiency is crucial for large campaigns, event notifications, or any scenario where timely communication is key.
- **Targeted Messaging:** The conditional logic feature in the premium version allows you to send targeted messages to specific respondents based on their form entries. This ensures that your communications are relevant and personalized, increasing engagement and response rates. For example, you could send follow-up emails only to users who expressed interest in a particular product or service.
- **Seamless Integration:** By leveraging Gravity Forms’ existing email fields, the plugin integrates smoothly into your existing workflows. There’s no need for additional plugins or complex setups—everything works out of the box, reducing potential technical issues and ensuring a hassle-free experience.
- **User-Friendly Setup:** The intuitive interface makes it easy to set up and manage mass email notifications, even for users with limited technical expertise. This accessibility means that anyone on your team can handle email campaigns, reducing the dependency on specialized knowledge or external help.
- **Scalable Solution:** Whether you’re managing a small list or a large database of form entries, this plugin scales to meet your needs. As your business grows and your communication needs become more complex, the plugin can handle the increased load without compromising performance or reliability.
